1. integrate the SIFT dataset into the model
2. the model should be designed carefully to work on multiple dimensions from 128 onwards
3. once integration and coding is done focus on learning and understanding the code line by line
4. prepare the defense for the code, implementation techniques and the tactics, libraries used. WHY?
